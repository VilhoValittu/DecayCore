# Reading DecayCore Output

## In brief

Start with System Health and the summary, then inspect magnitude, filter demand, phase, group delay, and the final impulse. A generated graph is a prediction; confirm the result with a new measurement.

## 1. What you get after a run

DecayCore produces:

1. Interactive dashboards in the UI (Left/Right analysis view).
2. A ZIP package saved to `Documents/DecayCore/filters/<version>/` (safe fallback used if needed):
   - FIR WAV files (either `L_...wav` + `R_...wav` or a single `Stereo_...wav`, depending on layout)
   - Summary report (`Summary_<type>_<fs>Hz.txt`)
   - Convolver configs (`Config_...cfg`, `camilladsp_...yml`)

The ZIP focuses on filters, configurations, and summary data. Use the interactive result graphs in the application for visual inspection.

## 2. Reading the dashboard (UI)

The result view groups the plots by purpose:

### 2.1 Magnitude and Alignment

Shows:
- Measured (blue)
- Target (green dashed)
- Predicted (orange)
- Level reference line and smart scan window shading
- Correction range shading (`mag_c_min` to `mag_c_max`)

Read it like this:
- Predicted should track target without narrow high-Q spikes.
- Strong LF lift means headroom risk; check Summary headroom section.

### 2.2 Confidence

Shows measurement confidence on a 0–100% scale. Low confidence reduces correction authority and is a reason to inspect the measurement before increasing correction strength.

### 2.3 Phase

Shows wrapped phase of the predicted response.
Use it mainly to see whether behavior looks smooth around crossover and correction limits.

### 2.4 Group Delay

Highlights delay structure over frequency.
- Broad LF structures often relate to room modes.
- Sharp local spikes can indicate reflection-related behavior.

### 2.5 Filter (dB)

This is the FIR gain curve after level-compensated plotting.
Use it to confirm boost/cut aggressiveness and low-frequency policy behavior.

### 2.6 A-FDW Effective BW (oct)

Shows effective adaptive bandwidth when available.
If unavailable, the panel displays "No A-FDW BW data (...)". This is expected in some modes.

## 3. Reading `Summary_...txt`

The summary is layered. Main blocks:

### 3.1 Executive Summary

Includes:
- Acoustic Score (L/R)
- Target Match (percentage + RMS dB)
- Confidence (L/R)
- RT60 wideband (L/R)
- Worst detected event (L/R)

### 3.2 Core Settings and Analysis Mode

Includes:
- Key settings used for generation
- Analysis mode (`native` or `comparison`)
- Comparison grid metadata when comparison mode is active
- Automatic-mode export block when `AUTO` was used:
  - selected target curve and selection method
  - target-selection trial grid (`top-N x trials`)
  - cached or searched best preset summary
  - excursion protection seed -> final frequency when auto-tuned
  - winner-polish results for `phase_limit` and `mag_c_min`:
    - `Phase-limit winner polish: applied (X -> Y Hz, rank A -> B, tested [...] Hz)` when the post-search polish improved the winner
    - `Phase-limit winner polish: not applied` when the original winner was already optimal
    - `Mag-c-min winner polish: tested, no change (kept X Hz, tested [...] Hz)` when no improvement was found

### 3.3 Guards and control blocks

Includes:
- Correction Guards (max cut, slope limits, low-bass cut policy)
- Temporal Decay Control (TDC) status and limits
- A-FDW status and effective bandwidth stats
- XO and phase clamp lines

### 3.4 RT60 and matching blocks

Includes:
- RT60 wideband and optional per-band values
- Confidence and leveling window info
- Target curve match lines for left/right

### 3.5 Alignment and gain staging

Includes:
- Peak (pre-norm), global offset, auto gain margin, applied auto gain
- Additional sections appended during export:
  - `DSP EFFECTIVE PARAMS`
  - `LEVELING`
  - `HEADROOM MANAGEMENT`
  - `BOOST/CUT DIAGNOSTICS`
  - `CLAMP DIAGNOSTICS`
  - `STAGE CHECKPOINTS`
  - `AUTO-ALIGN`
  - `ACOUSTIC EVENTS` (when detected)

## 4. Practical pass/fail checks

Use these first:

1. `Target Match` improves clearly versus uncorrected.
2. `Net boost peak (post global/headroom)` is not positive or only slightly positive.
3. `hard_clamp`/`soft_clip` counters are not excessive.
4. No unexpected large tilt in `LEVELING`.
5. `Final Max (filter+auto_gain+headroom)` stays sensible for your playback headroom.

## 5. If the result sounds wrong

- Too little bass:
  - Check `low_bass_cut_hz`
  - Check effective max boost and blocked boost reason
  - Check correction range upper/lower bounds
- Too bright or sharp:
  - Reduce correction range in upper mids/highs
  - Increase smoothing / reduce aggressive slope behavior
- Unstable imaging or odd timing:
  - Check `AUTO-ALIGN` delay and gain difference
  - Re-verify measurement consistency

Use re-measurement with filter enabled as the final validation.
